# React Crash Course

This project follows [this YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/LDB4uaJ87e0) as an opportunity to practice the basics of React.

The code for this project can also be found [here](https://github.com/bradtraversy/react-crash-2024) (including the theme files).

Note: This project was created using typescript instead of javascript as in the original tutorial so it is a little bit more complicated in syntax but has all the usual benefits of TS.
